User and Reference guide for CDMenu 1.01

What is it?
CDMenu is a program to display button based menu's.  The primary
purpose of the program is to support the autostart feature of CD's

The program displays a bitmap based splash screen and one or more buttons.
Clicking on a button can bring up a new menu or execute a program, URL, 
email, or open a document.

Setting up the program is very simple:
1> create a configuration file that describes the program behavior 
    (detailed below).
2> Create an AutoStart.inf file.  It should look something like this:

      -----cut------------cut------
      [autorun]
      open=\startup\cdmenu.exe
      icon=\startup\cdmenu.exe
		label=Acme Widgit CD
      -----cut------------cut------

3> Put the AutoStart.inf file at the root of the cd.
4> Create a directory, (ex: startup) at the root of the CD.
5> place CDMenu.exe, the config file, bitmaps, and wav files in that dir. 
6> Burn the CD and test.


This document is really about describing the cdmenu configuration file.
The default name for this file is CDMENU.CFG  You can use a different name
if you want but if you do you will need to provide the filename on the command
line.

The configuration file is broken up into sections, with each section 
representing a different menu page.  Each section contains settings describing
the attributes of the page and a list of buttons.  Each button consists of the
keyword "Button:" and then a list of settings describing the attributes of 
that button.

Here's an example of a valid cdmenu.cfg file:

      -----cut------------cut------
      [main]
      PageImage  = main.bmp
      PageSounds = start.wav,end.wav,click.wav

      Button:
         Text = Install
         Pos  = Right,Top,125,30
         Cmd  = \setup.exe
      Button:
         Text = Readme
         Pos  = movedown
         Cmd  = \Readme.txt
      Button:
         Text = Exit
         Pos  = movedown
         Cmd  =
      -----cut------------cut------

The first line: [main] tells the program that this is a new page
and that the page is called [main].  Every config file has to have a [main]
page.  This is the first page to display to the user when the program runs.
After that, there are a couple of lines of page settings, and then a list of
buttons.
Notice how each button is described: First there is a line that says Button:
and following that is a list of settings that describe the button.
There are lots of page and button settings and they're all described in the 
reference section below.  Keep in mind that almost all of them are optional
and the program makes reasonable choices when you don't specify them.

Lets look at a more detailed example:

      -----cut------------cut------
	  ;
	  ;	This is a sample CDMenu config file
	  ;
      [default]
      FileType  = pde,Adobe Acrobat,c:\cd_expedite42a-1\Acrobat\ar40eng.exe
      PageImage           = main.bmp
      PageTitleBar        = YES
      PageTitle           = Acme Wonder-wear CD!
      PageMessage         = Welcome the the great Acme Wonder-wear install CD!

      [main]
      PageSounds          = start.wav,end.wav,click.wav
      PageMessageFont     = Arial,18,8
      PageMessageColor    = 255,255,128
      PageMessageArea     = 100,125,300,50

      DefaultFont         = Arial,14,6
      DefaultFontColor    = 64,0,64
      DefaultColor 		  = 64,192,64

      Button:
         Text = Install
         Image= GreenMarble.bmp
         Pos  = Right,Top,125,30
         Cmd  = \setup.exe
      Button:
         Text = Docs
         Image= GreenMarble.bmp,0,30
         Pos  = movedown
         Cmd  = [docs]
      Button:
         Font = Ms Sans Serif,16,8
         Text = Exit
         Image= GreenMarble.bmp,0,60
         Pos  = ,+50,,
         Cmd  =

      [docs]
      DefaultImage = BlueMarble.bmp
      DefaultColor = 32,32,224

      Button:
         Text = Users Guide
         Pos  = left,top,125,30
         Cmd  = \userguide.pdf
      Button:
         Text = Whatsnew
         Cmd  = \whatsnew.txt
      Button:
         Text = back
         Cmd  = [main]
      -----cut------------cut------

OK, here we have 3 different sections, [default], [main], and [docs].
[default] actually doesn't represent a page, it's a special section 
where you can put settings that will apply to all the other sections
that don't explicitly have settings of their own.  So in this config file
we have 2 pages, the [main] page and the [docs] page.

Lets look at the [main] page in some detail:
Notice that the [main] section starts out with 4 settings, if you had
skipped ahead and read the reference section first, you would know that
these settings define what noises to annoy the user with and where and
how to display a message to the user.  The actual text of the message isn't
here, but thats OK because the [default] section told the program what to
use if we left it blank here.

After the 1st 4 settings, we have another set of 3 settings that all start
with "Default". These "Default" settings are all for describing the default
settings of the buttons in the page.  They're not necessarily needed here,
but it's less work than adding these setting for each button.  By the way,
if you haven't already guessed, these settings describe the font to use
on the buttons, and the button colors.  These buttons will be painted with
an image, but we specify the DefaultColor here anyway because it's used 
to calculate the colors of the 3D edges around the buttons.

OK, were almost done.  After all those page settings is the list of buttons.
The settings for these buttons are mildly interesting, so lets look at em:

The first button command will place a button in the upper right corner of the
window and the button will say "Install".  The button will have this cool 
green Marble look that it got by loading the GreenMarble.bmp file, and when
the user clicks on it, CDMenu will run the setup.exe program that is 
conveniently located in the root directory of the CD.

The next button will look at lot like the previous button.  It will be below
it, the bitmap will be shifted a little bit (30 pixels down to be exact) so 
it won't look like a copy of the button above it, and when the user clicks on
it, the page changes to the [docs] page.

The third and last button is the exit button.  Note that the Cmd setting is
blank.  The program exits when the user clicks on a button with an empty Cmd.

Lastly, I want to mention the FileType setting.  In the above example it is
the first setting in the [default] section.  If a button attempts to launch
a file type that windows doesn't know about, the program will look at any
FileType settings before giving up.  If it can find a match, it will give the
user the option to install the necessary program. So, if the user goes to the
[docs] page and clicks on the "User's Guide" button, and if the user had never
installed Adobe Acrobat on his/her machine, a message will appear telling the
user that it cannot open this document type and asks the user if he/she would
like to install the Adobe Acrobat Reader.

And very lastly, notice that the config file allows comments that are 
preceeded by a semi-colon.

If you've made it this far, you can figure out the rest. Good luck!

					Color = 12394856
Description  : This command defines the color for the face of the button.  
               Note that if an "Image" setting is used, you will never see
               this color, but the color is still be used get good colors
					for the 3D edges around the button.  The basic way of 
					specifying a color is to enter the red, green and blue values
					separated by commas.  All 3 values are from 0 to 255.
					Alternatively, you may specify the Hex value of the color ala
					WEB pages by preceeding the value with a # sign.  Finally, if
					you know the name of a system color you want, you can specify
					that too.  A complete list of the valid system colors is given
					in Appendix A.

Example      : Edge = 50,20
Description  : This defines the size of the border around the edges of the 
               window. When placing buttons, if you use values like Top,
               Left,Right or Bottom for the "Pos" setting, these Edge 
               settings help tell the buttons where to go.
Default Val  : 15,15
--

Font (optional)
Usage        : Font = FontName,Size,Weight
Example      : Font = Courier New,12,4

Default Val  : Arial,15,6
--

FontColor (optional)
Usage        : FontColor = RedVal,GreenVal,BlueVal
Example      : FontColor = 78,45,144
Description  : This defines the color of the font to use on the button. 
					See the "Color" option for more on how to specify a color.
Default Val  : System button text color
--

FontShadowMode (optional)
Usage        : FontShadowMode = OFF | Number
Examples     : FontShadowMode = OFF
             : FontShadowMode = 0
             : FontShadowMode = 2
Description  : This tells the text of the button what to do when the button
               is clicked. If OFF, the button sticks to the face of the button.
               Otherwise, the text stays in place and "floats" above the button
               when the button is pushed.  The number represents the number of
               pixels over where the shadow is drawn.  2 is a good value.
Default Val  : OFF
--

Gap (optional)
Usage        : Gap = XGap,YGap
Example      : Gap = 15,10
Description  : This defines the gap between successive buttons.  When placing 
               buttons, if you use values like movedown.moveright etc. for the
               "Pos" setting, these gap settings help tell the buttons where to
                go.
Default Val   : 5,5
--

HilightColor (optional)
Usage        : HilightColor = RedVal,GreenVal,BlueVal
Example      : HilightColor = 79,155,204
Description  : This defines the color to use for the button while the mouse is
					over the button.  In addition to all the ways you can specify
					a color that are described in the "Color" setting, you can also
					specify "Lighter" or "Darker"  which will be a lighter or darker
					permutation of the "Color" setting for the button.
Default      : Same color as "Color"
--

HilightImage (optional)
Usage        : HilightImage = BitmapFile[,XOffset,YOffset]
Examples     : HilightImage = OButton.bmp
             : HilightImage = Button.bmp,0,50
             : HilightImage = ,+50,+0
Description  : This tells the program to use a bitmap for the button when
					the user moves the mouse over the button.  An effective use
					of this option is to use an "Image" for the button, and a
					"HilightImage" that is like the Image bitmap but is different
					in a way that hilights the button.  See the description of 
					"Image" for more general information on specifying a bitmap.
Default Val  : No bitmap
--

Image (optional)
Usage        : Image = BitmapFile[,XOffset,YOffset]
Examples     : Image = Button.bmp
             : Image = Button.bmp,0,50
             : Image = ,+50,+0
Description  : This tells the program to use bitmap for the button face.
               If XOffset and YOffset are used, they specify a starting
               point in the bitmap to use on the upper-left corner of the
               button.  This allows you to put several button images in
               a single bitmap file.  The offset values may be relative
               to the previous button if prefixed by a '+' or a '-'. If
               the Image setting is blank, no bitmap is used.  If the 
               bitmap name is uded, but the offset params are used, the
               default image is assumed.
Default Val  : No bitmap

Description  : This defines the rectangle where the message will be 
               located.  The numbers are in pixels.  The numbers are

               old by now.
					See the "Color" option for more on how to specify a color.
Default Val  : system text color
--

MessageFont (optional)
Usage        : Font = FontName,Size,Weight
Example      : Font = Ms Sans Serif,15,8
Description  : This defines the font to use for the message. The weight is
               the Boldness and ranges from 1 to 10.
Default Val  : Arial,15,6
--

MessageJustify (optional)
Usage        : PageMessageJustify = Center|Left|Right
Example      : PageMessageJustify = Right
Description  : Sets the justification for the current message. Messages may
			   also contain \n for newlines
Default Val  : Center
--

Pos (optional)
Usage        : Pos = Left#,Top#,XSize#,YSize#
             : Pos = moveleft | moveup | moveright | movedown
Examples     : Pos = 50,60,125,30
             : Pos = Left,Top,125,30
             : Pos = CenterX,CenterY,125,30
             : Pos = movedown
             : Pos = ,+40,,
Description  : This is simpler than it looks.  This tells the program where
               to place the button on the page.  You can use "Left", "Right"
               or "CenterX" for the Left number which will place the button
               next to an edge (see XEdge) or center the button. You can use
               "Top", "Bottom", or "CenterY" for the Top parameter which will
               do the right thing.  You can make the numbers relative by 
               preceeding them with a '+' or '-' to make the button relative
               to the previous button.  Finally, you can use "moveleft", 
               "moveup", "moveright" or "movedown" as a simple way to position
               the buttons relative to the previous button.

             : PushImage = ,+50,+0
Description  : This tells the program to use a bitmap for the button when
					the user moves clicks on the button.  An effective use
					of this option is to use an "Image" for the button, and a
					"PushImage" that is like the Image bitmap but is different
					in a way that hilights the button.  See the description of 
					"Image" for more general information on specifying a bitmap.

Usage        : Message = Text
Example      : Message = &Install
